This SVG heavy test site was created originally as a way to utilise lots of photographs I was taking at the time.

It needs expanding to include more variety of SVG shapes and some more jQuery animations (I was new to it at the time) and other polishing elements.

Eventually I'd like to find a way to include sound in this piece but that might be for another project.

If you don't want to set it up on your own machine you can see the latest code running here: http://www.peteheaughie.com/ritualiser/
